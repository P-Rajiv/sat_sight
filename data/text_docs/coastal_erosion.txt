Coastal erosion is the process by which local sea level rise, strong wave action, and coastal flooding wear down or carry away rocks, soils, and/or sands along the coast. All coastlines are affected by storms and other natural events that cause erosion; the combination of storm surge at high tide with additional effects from strong waves—conditions commonly associated with landfalling tropical storms—creates the most damaging conditions. The extent and severity of the problem is worsening with global sea level rise, but it differs in different parts of the country, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

In the United States, coastal erosion is responsible for roughly $500 million per year in coastal property loss, including damage to structures and loss of land. To mitigate coastal erosion, the federal government spends an average of $150 million every year on beach nourishment and other shoreline erosion control measures.1 In addition to beach erosion, more than 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands are lost annually—the equivalent of seven football fields disappearing every hour of every day.2 The aggregate result is that the United States lost an area of wetlands larger than the state of Rhode Island between 1998 and 2009.3

While coastal erosion affects all regions of the United States, erosion rates and potential impacts are highly localized. Average coastline recession rates of 25 feet per year are not uncommon on some barrier islands in the Southeast, and rates of 50 feet per year have occurred along the Great Lakes. Severe storms can remove wide beaches, along with substantial dunes, in a single event. In undeveloped areas, these high recession rates are not likely to cause significant concern, but in heavily populated locations, one or two feet of coastal erosion may be considered catastrophic.

Sea level rise will cause an increase in coastal erosion and the human response will be critical. If we choose to build hard structures in an attempt to keep the shoreline position stable, we will lose beach area due to scour. If we let the shoreline migrate naturally, we can expect to see erosion rates increase, especially in regions of the coast that are already dealing with starved sediment budgets and rapid shoreline migration. Increases in storm frequency and intensity in the future will also cause increased coastal erosion.

The U.S. Geological Survey's Coastal Change Hazards Portal offers a Coastal Vulnerability Index that can help identify locations where coastal erosion may occur along undeveloped coastlines. Information is also available on various forms of Storm-Induced Coastal Change. 

Shoreline "hardening" 
In the past, protecting the coast often meant "hardening" the shoreline with structures such as seawalls, groins, rip-rap, and levees. As understanding of natural shoreline function improves, there is a growing acceptance that structural solutions may cause more problems than they solve.4 Structural projects interfere with natural water currents and prevent sand from shifting along coastlines. Additional reasons to avoid structural protective measures include the high costs to install and maintain them, state or local prohibitions against them, their propensity to cause erosion to adjacent beaches and dunes, and the unintended diversion of stormwater and waves onto other properties.

Beach nourishment
Many states have shifted toward non-structural shoreline stabilization techniques. Unlike structural projects, nature-based or "green infrastructure" protection measures enhance the natural ability of shorelines to absorb and dissipate storm energy without interfering with natural coastal processes.5

One common strategy for dealing with coastal erosion is beach nourishment—placing additional sand on a beach to serve as a buffer against erosion or to enhance the recreational value of the beach. However, beach nourishment has also become a controversial shore protection measure, in part because it has the potential to adversely impact a variety of natural resources. Consequently, these projects must comply with a wide range of complex laws and regulations. Beach nourishment is also expensive: check the Beach Nourishment Viewer to explore details about sand placement efforts for more than 2,000 beach nourishment projects since 1923. Adding sand to a beach does not guarantee that it will stay there. Some communities bring in huge volumes of sand repeatedly, only to see it wash out to sea in the next season's storms.

Nonetheless, many communities still practice beach nourishment. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized to carry out beach nourishment for shoreline protection: their Beach Nourishment site describes the benefits of adding sand to beaches. USACE also offers a well illustrated booklet, How Beach Nourishment Projects Work.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has re-emphasized the need to consider a whole range of solutions to coastal erosion, not only structural solutions. For instance, non-structural shore protection methods that have the potential to control erosion include stabilizing dunes with fences and/or native vegetation, wetland protection and restoration, and relocation or removal of structures and debris. 

Coastal restoration
Even with the implementation of coastal shoreline erosion and risk reduction measures, residual risk remains. Some areas are constantly in danger during severe storms. For some regions of the country, the more intense storms are predicted to increase in strength and frequency as climate continues to change, though the overall frequency of all storms may decrease. In some cases, the only way to prevent structures from causing harm may be to remove them entirely. After the structure has been removed, communities usually dedicate the land to public open space or transfer it to land trusts for protection.

Coastal restoration projects can be highly cost-effective for communities. Benefits of returning land to its undeveloped state include buffering storm surges, safeguarding coastal homes and businesses, sequestering carbon and other pollutants, creating nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important fish species, and restoring open space and wildlife that support recreation, tourism, and the culture of coastal communities.

Coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon. It happens when there is not enough fresh material being deposited onto the beach to balance off the transfer of material away from the shoreline. Numerous coastal landforms experience natural quasi-periodic cycles of erosion and accretion over periods of time ranging from days to years.

In this article, we will cover the entire Coastal Erosion in general, Recent News and Findings, What is coastal erosion? Coastal erosion in the Indian context, Causes of coastal erosion, Coastal erosion effects, and some of the key highlights.

India's coastline plays a crucial role in controlling the country's coasts and achieving sustainability.

With a 7,516.6 km long coastline and an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 2.02 million sq. km, India has rich marine resources.
Effective use of these resources is important for inclusive growth. It also supports initiatives like Make in India.
The sustainable use of ocean resources can contribute to India's economic growth and sustainable development.
Coastal ecosystems support community development, decentralized governance, and good governance practices.
Coastal infrastructure development promotes eco-friendly tourism and creates employment opportunities.
The development of fishing resources and mariculture can improve livelihoods. They support the fishery sector at large.
The oceans also provide energy sources like petroleum, gas hydrates, and tidal energy.
Coastal resources contribute to food safety, nutrition, and reducing malnutrition.
Improved connectivity along the coastline enhances transportation and lowers logistics costs, benefiting trade.

Coastal erosion is the process by which local sea-level rise, powerful wave action, and coastal flooding destroy or carry away rocks or sands along the shore.

Erosion and Accretion are mutually supportive processes. Sand and other sediments must have gathered elsewhere if they have migrated from one side.
It involves the loss of land and human habitation due to seawater washing away portions of the soil along the shoreline.
On the other hand, soil accretion results in a rise in land area.
If current beaches are reduced in size or disappear entirely, recreational activities may be impacted. The way of life in coastal areas may also be affected.

Coastal erosion contributes to the loss of animal habitat as well as economic loss to the fishing industry.
Coastal erosion makes the landscape vulnerable, and in addition to this, climate change threatens these regions by rising sea levels and causing coastal floods all around the planet.
Coastal erosion has a huge economic impact in addition to environmental and social ones. Some of the economic impacts are damage to property, loss of tourism, shipping, trade, fishing, etc.
Coastal erosion is an increasing worry for countries all over the world due to lost land and ruined assets, as well as reduced revenue potential due to the threat it poses to tourism and other industries.
Recreational activities and the food industry are affected by coastal erosion, which in turn impacts local employment and income.

Coastal Erosion can be controlled by various methods, and they are listed below

Control of Beach Groundwater Table or Beach Dewatering System
Vegetation Planting
Use of Geo-synthetic Tubes / Bags
Artificial Beach Nourishment
Protective Structures – Seawalls, Revetments
Structures to Trap Sediment Movement
Combination of Artificial Beach Nourishment & Structures

What is India doing to protect the coastline?
The management of coastal areas in India is being promoted through various initiatives. Some of these measures include:

Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ): The MoEFCC introduced the CRZ notification in 1991. It aims to control activities in coastal regions and conserve the coastal environment.
National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management: This center works towards integrated and sustainable management of coastal ecosystems. It works to benefit the local coastal communities.
Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan: This approach aims to manage the coast by considering all aspects of the coastal zone. This includes physical and political boundaries to achieve sustainability.

Plants used to prevent coastal erosion
The best defence against sea storms and erosion is known to be coastal habitats like mangroves, coral reefs, and lagoons because they can deflect and absorb a lot of the energy of sea storms. Thus, it is crucial to preserve these natural areas for both environmental conservation and shore protection.
One of the greatest trees for preventing soil erosion in the coastal region is the mangrove forest. The mangrove plants’ roots do a great job of holding dirt in place.
Mangroves provide stress absorption. They lessen tidal and wave heights, safeguard coastlines from erosion, and also lessen cyclone and tsunami-related catastrophes.

Causes of Coastal Erosion in India
Following are some of the major causes of coastal erosion in India:

Natural causes of coastal erosion
Waves: Waves are the most important natural cause of coastal erosion. They break against the shoreline and erode the coast over time.
Currents: Currents can erode the coast by carrying away sand and other sediments.
Tides: Tides can erode the coast by causing sea levels to rise and fall.
Storms: Storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons, can cause severe coastal erosion. They generate large waves and storm surges.
Man-made causes of coastal erosion
Coastal development: The construction of seawalls, breakwaters, and marinas can alter the natural flow of waves and currents. This leads to increased coastal erosion.
Deforestation: Deforestation can lead to increased coastal erosion by removing trees and other vegetation that help to hold soil in place.
Climate change: Climate change is causing sea levels to rise and storms to become more intense. Both of these can accelerate coastal erosion.

Way Forward
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and/or Ministry of Home Affairs may develop suitable norms for erosion mitigation measures to prevent erosion, and both the Union and the State Governments develop a policy to deal with the significant population displacement brought on by coastal and river erosion, as had been suggested by the XVth Finance Commission.
The National Disaster Mitigation Fund‘s (NDMF) “Mitigation Measures to Prevent Erosion” and the NDRF’s “Resettlement of Displaced People Affected by Erosion” funds have both received specific recommendations from the Commission (National Disaster Response Fund).
Conclusion
The coastal areas where land and water meet are biologically sensitive and dynamic because marine and coastal ecosystems constantly interact. These areas have a diverse ecosystem that includes mangroves, water features, seaweed, coral reefs, fisheries, other marine life, and other coastal and marine flora. These ecosystems safeguard the area from saline winds, cyclones, tsunami waves, etc. They also support carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and the provision of raw materials for various manufacturing processes. Therefore, coastline erosion has put us in a precarious predicament that we must resolve.
