Agricultural expansion describes the growth of agricultural land (arable land, pastures, etc.) especially in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The agricultural expansion is often explained as a direct consequence of the global increase in food and energy requirements due to population growth (both which in turn have been attributed to agricultural expansion itself[1][2]), with an estimated expectation of 10 billion people on Earth by end of this century. It is foreseen that most of the world's non-agrarian ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic) will be affected adversely, from habitat loss, land degradation, overexploitation, and other problems. The intensified food (and biofuel) production will in particular affect the tropical regions.

Most modern agriculture relies on intensive methods. Further expansion of the predominant farming types that rest on a small number of highly productive crops has led to a significant loss of biodiversity on a global scale already.[3] Moreover, agricultural expansion continues to be the main driver of deforestation and forest fragmentation. Large-scale commercial agriculture (primarily cattle ranching and cultivation of soya bean and oil palm) accounted for 40 percent of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2010, and local subsistence agriculture for another 33 percent.[4] In the light of the already occurring and potential massive ecological effects, the need for sustainable practices is more urgent than ever.

The FAO predicts that global arable land use will continue to grow from a 1.58 billion hectares (3.9×109 acres) in 2014 to 1.66 billion hectares (4.1×109 acres) in 2050, with most of this growth projected to result from developing countries. At the same time, arable land use in developed countries is likely to continue its decline.[5]

A well-known example of already ongoing agricultural expansion is the proliferation of palm oil production areas or the land conversion/deforestation for soy bean production in South America. Today's land grabbing activities are often a consequence of the strive for agricultural land by growing economies.[6]

In the beginning of the 21st century the palm oil industry caused a massive deforestation in Borneo with heavy consequences.[7]

icultural expansion is the conversion of non-agricultural land like natural forests, grasslands and wetlands into crops or agricultural land. Agricultural expansion is a critical environmental issue that has far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, climate change, and human livelihoods.

 The expansion of agriculture, driven by the growing global population and increasing demand for food and commodities, has played a significant role in accelerating deforestation. Forests are often cleared to make way for large-scale commercial agriculture, such as palm oil plantations, soybean cultivation, cattle ranching, and timber plantations.



The scale of deforestation due to agricultural expansion

1. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an estimated 5.2 million hectares of forest were lost each year between 2010 and 2015.

2. The World Bank reports that agriculture is responsible for around 80% of global deforestation, making it the single most significant cause of forest loss.

3. In tropical regions, such as the Amazon rainforest, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia, agricultural expansion accounts for approximately 90% of deforestation.

4. The Amazon rainforest alone lost over 2.2 million square kilometres of forest cover between 1970 and 2020, with a substantial portion cleared for agriculture.



Consequences of Deforestation

• Loss of Biodiversity: Forests are biodiverse ecosystems, providing habitat and shelter to countless plant and animal species. The destruction of these habitats results in the loss of biodiversity, leading to species extinction.

• Climate Change: Deforestation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change as Trees absorb CO2 during photosynthesis.

• Soil Degradation: Forests play a crucial role in maintaining soil health by preventing erosion and promoting nutrient recycling. When forests are cleared for agriculture, the soil becomes easy to erosion, leading to loss of fertility and increased runoff of sediments into water bodies.

• Disruption of Water Cycles: Forests are essential in regulating local and regional water cycles. Their removal can result in reduced groundwater recharge, and increased threat to droughts and floods.



Solutions to Mitigate Agricultural Expansion causing Deforestation

• Sustainable Agricultural Practices: Promoting sustainable agriculture, such as organic farming, can help meet the growing demand for food without necessitating large-scale deforestation. These practices integrate trees and crops, enhancing biodiversity and soil fertility.

• Land Use Planning: Implementing comprehensive land use planning can help identify suitable areas for agriculture while safeguarding ecologically sensitive regions, such as primary forests and biodiversity hotspots.

• Certification and Traceability: Encouraging certification schemes, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), promotes responsible production and trade of agricultural commodities, ensuring they come from sustainable sources.

• Consumer Awareness: Educating consumers about the environmental impact of agricultural products and the importance of supporting sustainable and deforestation-free practices can drive demand for environmentally responsible products.



Conclusion

The connection between agricultural expansion and deforestation is a significant global concern that needs urgent and effective efforts. Balancing the need for food production with conservation and sustainable land use practices is essential to protect the world's forests, biodiversity, and climate.

 By adopting sustainable agricultural practices, effective land use planning, and supporting forest protection initiatives, we can work towards decreasing the adverse effects of agricultural expansion on deforestation, ensuring a greener and more sustainable future for generations to come.




Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water, for example – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures. Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.
In an effort to prevent and halt the degradation of such ecosystems, many countries are sustainably managing their forests, protecting sites critical to biodiversity, and enacting national conservation legislation and policies. However, other opportunities are being lost. The emergence of COVID-19 was an opportunity to integrate biodiversity considerations into economic recovery measures and build a more viable future. But biodiversity has been largely neglected in recovery spending.

The world’s forest area continues to shrink, mainly due to agricultural expansion
The world’s forest area continues to decline, but at a slightly slower rate than in previous decades. The proportion of forests fell from 31.9 per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020, representing a net loss of almost 100 million hectares. Agricultural expansion is driving almost 90 per cent of global deforestation, including 49.6 per cent from expansion for cropland and 38.5 per cent for livestock grazing.

Changes in forest area vary widely from region to region. Asia, Europe and Northern America showed an overall increase in forest area from 2000 to 2020 due to afforestation, landscape restoration and the natural expansion of forests. In contrast, significant losses were observed in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, mostly due to the conversion of forests into agricultural land.

The felling of forests continues, despite major gains in several regions. Between 2010 and 2021, the area of forest land under certification schemes increased by 35 per cent. The proportion of forests under a long-term management plan increased from 54 per cent in 2010 to 58 per cent in 2020. More than 700 million hectares of forest (18 per cent) were in legally established protected areas in 2020.

While nearly all forests in Central Asia, Europe and Western Asia fall under a management plan, the managed proportion remains low in Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa.

Global efforts to promote access and benefit-sharing of genetic resources gains momentum
The world continues to make progress on implementing frameworks for the sustainable use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. The Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity provides a transparent legal framework for the implementation of fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. As of February 2022, 132 countries and the European Union had ratified the Protocol, and 68 countries have devised at least one legislative, administrative or policy measure to ensure its implementation.

Also by that date, the number of contracting parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture had grown to 148 from 135 in 2015. Seventy-nine countries have submitted a national report on the implementation of the Treaty’s provisions, a sizeable increase from 12 countries in 2016. In addition, the number of Standard Material Transfer Agreements has increased, from 55,352 in 2015 to 81,556 in 2022, indicating that more users are benefiting from the Treaty’s Multilateral System for research, breeding and training.

The risk of species extinction continues to rise and is highest in Asia and small island developing States
The risk of species extinction is increasing at a rate unprecedented in human history. The Red List Index, which measures the overall extinction risk of species in selected taxonomic groups, reveals a deterioration of 9.2 per cent between 2000 and 2022. Wide variations are found among regions in both the overall prevalence of extinction risk and the rate of deterioration. Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, and small island developing States suffer from more severe risk and faster deterioration than the global average. The main drivers of these declines are the unsustainability of agriculture and the over-harvest of wild species. Human activities such as logging and farming are encroaching upon habitats, putting about 20 per cent of reptile species, for example, at risk. To conserve and sustainably use biodiversity, key actions are urgently needed, including reversing the net loss of habitat, transforming land management and transitioning to sustainable agriculture.

Nearly half of areas identified as key for global biodiversity are under protection, though progress lags in four regions
Given the wide variation in the distribution of biodiversity and the threats to it around the planet, it is important that protected areas be located strategically. Safeguarding key biodiversity areas (KBAs) through the establishment of protected areas or other effective area-based conservation measures is helping prevent the rapid loss of biodiversity. Globally, the mean percentage coverage of KBAs by protected areas increased from over one quarter in 2000 to nearly one half in 2021. Despite this encouraging trend, the growth of coverage has slowed in recent years. Moreover, coverage is uneven. Four regions – Northern Africa and Western Asia Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, and Oceania – still have mean coverage of less than 35 per cent across marine, terrestrial, freshwater and mountain KBAs.

National planning processes are increasingly reflecting the value of biodiversity; still, progress is too slow
Biodiversity directly or indirectly contributes to the attainment of most SDGs. The number of countries incorporating ecosystem and biodiversity values into national accounting and reporting systems is steadily trending upwards. The majority of countries have established national targets in this regard, in accordance with the Aichi Biodiversity Target 22 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020. By January 2022, 37 per cent of countries assessed are on track to achieve or exceed their national targets; 58 per cent have made progress towards their targets but at an insufficient rate; and 5 per cent reported that they are making no headway or moving away from their national targets. Despite important gains, Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 was not met by 2020. Building back better from COVID-19 is an opportunity to integrate biodiversity considerations into economic recovery measures to build a more sustainable future – while reducing the risk of future pandemics. However, this opportunity is not being seized. To date, biodiversity has been a largely neglected area in recovery spending.

COP26: Agricultural expansion drives almost 90 percent of global deforestation
FAO Remote Sensing Survey reveals new findings

Deforestation is the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure

Rome – Agricultural expansion drives almost 90 percent of global deforestation – an impact much greater than previously thought, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said when releasing the first findings of its new Global Remote Sensing Survey today.  

Deforestation is the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure. Worldwide, more than half of forest loss is due to conversion of forest into cropland, whereas livestock grazing is responsible for almost 40 percent of forest loss, according to the new study.

The new data also confirms an overall slowdown in global deforestation while warning that tropical rainforests, in particular, are under high pressure from agricultural expansion. 

“According to FAO’s latest Global Forest Resources Assessment we have lost 420 million hectares of forest since 1990,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said today in a speech prepared for a 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties’ (COP26) high-level dialogue entitled “Upscaling Actions to Turn the Tide on Deforestation” where FAO presented the new findings. To this end, he emphasized that increasing agri-food productivity to meet the new demands of a growing population and halting deforestation are not mutually exclusive objectives.

Turning the tide on deforestation and scaling up the hard-won progress on this front is of vital importance to build back better and greener from the COVID-19 pandemic, Qu added.

To succeed in such endeavour, we need to know where and why deforestation and forest degradation happens and where the action is needed, the Director-General said, noting that this can only be achieved by combining the latest technological innovations with local expertise on the ground. The new survey serves as a good example of such approach. 

Increasing agri-food productivity to meet the new demands of a growing population and halting deforestation are not mutually exclusive objectives. More than 20 developing countries have already shown that it is possible to do so. Indeed, latest data confirms that deforestation has been successfully reduced in South-America and Asia

Tropical forests are under threat

According to the new data, in 2000-2018, the vast majority of the deforestation took place in the tropical biomes. Despite a slowdown in deforestation in South America and Asia, the tropical rainforests in these regions continue to record the highest deforestation rates.

Deforestation drivers differ across the world’s regions

Agriculture remains the main driver of deforestation in all regions except for Europe, where urban and infrastructure development have a higher impact, the study says. Conversion to cropland dominates forest loss in Africa and Asia, with over 75 percent of the forest area lost converted to cropland. In South America, almost three quarters of deforestation is due to livestock grazing. 

The FAO-led study was conducted using satellite data and tools developed in partnership with NASA and Google, and in close collaboration with more than 800 national experts from almost 130 countries.

The High-level Dialogue brought together the heads and principals of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests member organizations to build momentum on forest-based climate actions under the UN Secretary-General initiative on Turning the Tide on Deforestation. The event will also be a major contribution towards the Stockholm+50 Summit, the 17th session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF17) and the in-depth review of SDG15 (Life on land) by the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in 2022.

FAO’s work on halting deforestation

Considering the multiple linkages between forests, agriculture and food security, FAO’s new strategic framework will lead efforts to transform agri-food systems to be more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable.  

Together with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP), FAO supports more than 60 countries in implementing strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through UN-REDD.

FAO is also co-leading the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration with UNEP, an important opportunity to accelerate innovative ideas into ambitious actions.

Moreover, the recent UN Food Systems Summit formed a coalition between producer and consumer countries, companies and international organizations to halt deforestation and the harmful environmental impacts of converting land to produce agricultural commodities.

The Collaborative Partnership on Forests, led by FAO, uniting 15 international organizations, is developing a joint initiative to Turn the Tide on Deforestation to accelerate actions and scale up impact.
